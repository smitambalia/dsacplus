# Linked List
## Reverse the linked-list
    - will require 3 pointer logic -> previous , current , forward
    - current points to head of the linked-list
    - previous points to null
    - forward points to next of current of the node
    - solve one case , rest will be taken care by recursion

## Find the middle node of a linked-list
    - slow and fast variable approch 
    - slow increases one step and fast variable increases two steps
