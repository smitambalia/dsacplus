### 3 types of solving DP problem 

1) Top-Down approch
2) Bottom-up approch
3) Space optimisation approch


-- Top-Down approch ( Recursion and Memoisation )
    - Find out the type of Data structure  , i.e 1D / 2D / 3D array 

- Bottom-Up approch


- Storage optimisation solution 
    Note : Dont need extra array to store the data therefore the space complexity of the algo becomes O(1)
    - Top-Down and Bottom-Up approch require extra array to store the calculated operation ,
        but it reduces the exponential time complexity to O(n)
